"Bigger" is a thrilling game where you control a frog born from a forbidden experiment that grows bigger by rampaging through the buildings. As a result, your frog will become even more unstoppable. With limited time to wreak havoc as other frogs race you to break the finite buildings Earth has to offer, your goal is to become the biggest froggo there ever was and dominate the world.
